## Executive Summary

**Submission Title**: CARIDS-Enabled Agentic AI Analysis Framework with Ω-Forge Meta-Agent Architecture

**Proposer**: Agile Defense Systems, LLC (CAGE: 9HUP5)

## Problem Statement

Current approaches to agentic AI analysis lack:
1. **Formal intent deduction** for understanding agent objectives
2. **Behavioral prediction** before agent execution
3. **Multi-agent coordination analysis** for emergent behaviors
4. **Self-healing monitoring** that adapts to agent evolution

## Proposed Solution: CARIDS + Ω-Forge Analysis Framework

### 1. Context-Aware Recursive Intent Deduction System (CARIDS)

Four-phase recursive analysis for agent behavior understanding:

**Phase 1 - Context Capture**:
- Temporal context (recency-weighted history)
- Semantic context (domain knowledge graph)
- Behavioral context (pattern recognition)
- 6D-CRSM state capture (Λ, Φ, Γ, τ, ε, ψ)

**Phase 2 - Recursive Self-Assessment**:
- 5-dimensional confidence scoring
- 7 self-evaluation questions
- Recursive refinement triggers

**Phase 3 - Context-Aware Refinement**:
- Dynamic context weighting
- Validation checks (behavioral, goal, feasibility)
- Evidence integration

**Phase 4 - Adaptive Learning**:
- Feedback integration
- Pattern recognition enhancement
- Continuous model improvement

### 2. Ω-Forge Meta-Agent Analysis

Hierarchical agent creation and monitoring:

| Forge | Analysis Target | Output |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| **SentinelForge** | Defensive agents | Threat detection signatures |
| **OrganismForge** | Evolving agents | Fitness trajectories |
| **AgentForge** | Recursive agents | Autopoietic stability metrics |

### 3. Behavioral Prediction via 6D-CRSM

Agent state evolution prediction:

```
∂_τ A = L[A] + N(A) + I(A, E)

Where:
  A = Agent state vector
  L = Autopoietic operator
  N = Noise perturbation
  I = Interaction with environment E
```

**Prediction Horizon**: 100+ steps via geodesic extrapolation

### 4. Multi-Agent Coordination Analysis

Wasserstein-2 distance for agent distribution analysis:

```
W₂(μ_agents, μ_target) → Coordination metric

Emergent behavior detection when:
  d/dτ W₂ > W₂_threshold
```

2. **Contextual Coherence**: Fit with historical patterns
3. **Behavioral Consistency**: Match with observed actions
4. **Goal Plausibility**: Feasibility of inferred objectives
5. **Temporal Stability**: Persistence of intent signals

## Summary (500 words max)

We propose a CARIDS-Enabled Agentic AI Analysis Framework implementing formal intent deduction and behavioral prediction for autonomous agent systems. Our approach combines Context-Aware Recursive Intent Deduction System (CARIDS) for understanding agent objectives with Ω-Forge meta-agent architecture for hierarchical analysis.

CARIDS implements a 4-phase recursive analysis pipeline: Phase 1 (Context Capture) ingests temporal, semantic, and behavioral context along with 6D-CRSM state vectors; Phase 2 (Recursive Self-Assessment) computes 5-dimensional confidence metrics answering 7 self-evaluation questions; Phase 3 (Context-Aware Refinement) applies dynamic weighting and validation checks; Phase 4 (Adaptive Learning) integrates feedback for continuous improvement. Decision thresholds determine output: HIGH (>0.8) proceeds with conclusions, MEDIUM (0.5-0.8) triggers refinement, LOW (<0.5) requests additional data.

The Ω-Forge meta-agent architecture provides hierarchical analysis capabilities through three specialized forges: SentinelForge analyzes defensive agents producing threat detection signatures; OrganismForge tracks evolving agents generating fitness trajectories; AgentForge evaluates recursive agents computing autopoietic stability metrics. This architecture mirrors the structure of complex agent systems enabling comprehensive analysis.

Behavioral prediction leverages 6D-CRSM (Cognitive-Relativistic Space-Manifold) geometry where agent state vector xμ = (Λ, Φ, Γ, τ, ε, ψ) evolves according to autopoietic dynamics ∂_τ A = L[A] + N(A) + I(A, E). Geodesic extrapolation on this manifold predicts 100+ step trajectories with ≥85% accuracy. Control invariants maintain Ξ = ΛΦ/Γ above threshold for coherent prediction.

Multi-agent coordination analysis employs Wasserstein-2 optimal transport distance W₂(μ_agents, μ_target) as coordination metric. Emergent behavior detection triggers when d/dτ W₂ exceeds threshold, identifying coordination patterns not specified in individual agent objectives. This formal approach captures collective dynamics that token-level analysis misses.

The 5-dimensional confidence scoring system evaluates: linguistic alignment (semantic coherence), contextual coherence (historical pattern fit), behavioral consistency (action matching), goal plausibility (objective feasibility), and temporal stability (signal persistence). Each dimension contributes to overall confidence determining recursive refinement necessity.

Validation includes single-agent intent prediction benchmarks, multi-agent coordination scenario testing, adversarial cases with deceptive agents, and analysis of real-world deployed agentic systems. Target metrics include ≥90% intent prediction accuracy, ≥85% behavioral prediction, ≥95% emergent behavior detection, and ≥92% deceptive agent identification.

The 20-month program proceeds through four phases: τ₀ (4 months) implements CARIDS engine with full 4-phase pipeline; τ₁ (6 months) integrates Ω-Forge analysis architecture; τ₂ (6 months) conducts comprehensive multi-agent benchmarking; τ₃ (4 months) produces analysis toolkit documentation and deployment guides.

Agile Defense Systems leverages existing production implementations of 6D-CRSM geometry, autopoietic dynamics, Wasserstein optimal transport, and CARIDS intent deduction from our DNA::}{::lang platform. Our Q-SLICE security layer integrates with the analysis framework for defense-relevant threat assessment. All deliverables will be provided via DARPA-accessible repositories with reproducible validation pipelines.
