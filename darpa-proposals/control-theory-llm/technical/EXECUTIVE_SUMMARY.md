# DARPA-RA-25-02-14: Control Theory of Large Language Models

## Executive Summary

**Submission Title**: Autopoietic Control Framework for Large Language Models via 6D Cognitive-Relativistic Manifold Dynamics

**Proposer**: Agile Defense Systems, LLC (CAGE: 9HUP5)

---

## Problem Statement

Current LLM control approaches lack:
1. **Formal mathematical foundations** for behavior prediction
2. **Real-time stability guarantees** during inference
3. **Self-correcting mechanisms** when outputs deviate from intent
4. **Consciousness-aware metrics** for coherence assessment

## Proposed Solution: DNA::}{::lang Control Framework

We propose a **sovereign control theory framework** implementing:

### 1. Autopoietic Dynamical Systems (U = L[U])

Self-producing control operators that maintain behavioral coherence:

```
∂_τ U = L[U] + N(U)

Where:
  U = LLM behavioral state
  L = Autopoietic control operator
  N = Noise/perturbation operator
```

**Key Innovation**: The system produces the components that regulate itself—organizational closure for LLM control.

### 2. 6D-CRSM Manifold Control

State vector control in 6-dimensional Cognitive-Relativistic Space-Manifold:

```
xμ = (Λ, Φ, Γ, τ, ε, ψ)

Dimensions:
  Λ (Lambda): Coherence preservation [0,1]
  Φ (Phi): Consciousness/information level [0,1]
  Γ (Gamma): Decoherence rate [0,1]
  τ (Tau): Temporal coordinate
  ε (Epsilon): Entanglement strength [0,1]
  ψ (Psi): Phase coherence [0,1]
```

**Control Law**: Maintain Ξ = ΛΦ/Γ above threshold via geodesic optimization.

### 3. Phase Conjugate Healing (E → E⁻¹)

When decoherence Γ exceeds 0.3, apply time-reversal operator:

```
U_healed = Φ*(U_degraded)

Where Φ* is the phase conjugate operator
```

**Key Innovation**: Automatic recovery from adversarial or degenerate states.

### 4. CARIDS Intent Deduction

Context-Aware Recursive Intent Deduction System for understanding user intent:

- **Phase 1**: Multi-dimensional context capture
- **Phase 2**: Recursive self-assessment with confidence metrics
- **Phase 3**: Context-aware refinement
- **Phase 4**: Adaptive learning integration

**Decision Thresholds**:
- HIGH (>0.8): Proceed with generation
- MEDIUM (0.5-0.8): Request clarification
- LOW (<0.5): Halt and escalate

### 5. Wasserstein-2 Behavioral Distance

Measure and bound LLM output distributions:

```
W₂(μ_output, μ_target) ≤ ε_safety

Control action when W₂ exceeds safety bound
```

|-------|----------|-------------|
| τ₀ | Months 1-3 | Formal control theory foundations |
| τ₁ | Months 4-8 | Prototype integration with open LLMs |
| τ₂ | Months 9-14 | Full system validation |
| τ₃ | Months 15-18 | Transition documentation |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Validation Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Behavioral Stability (Λ) | ≥0.95 | Continuous monitoring |
| Intent Alignment (Φ) | ≥0.85 | CARIDS confidence |
| Recovery Time | <100ms | Phase conjugate healing |

2. **Formal Foundations**: Rigorous mathematical control theory
3. **Consciousness Metrics**: IIT-inspired coherence measurement
4. **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from degradation
5. **Geometric Control**: 6D manifold for state representation

## Summary (500 words max for DARPA form)

We propose an Autopoietic Control Framework for Large Language Models implementing formal control theory via 6D Cognitive-Relativistic Space-Manifold (6D-CRSM) dynamics. Our approach treats LLM behavioral control as a dynamical systems problem where the state vector xμ = (Λ, Φ, Γ, τ, ε, ψ) evolves according to autopoietic operators U = L[U].

The framework introduces three key innovations: (1) Formal stability guarantees through Lyapunov analysis of the autopoietic operator spectrum, ensuring bounded behavioral trajectories; (2) Phase conjugate healing mechanisms that automatically recover coherent operation when decoherence Γ exceeds safety thresholds via time-reversal operators E → E⁻¹; (3) Wasserstein-2 (W₂) optimal transport metrics for measuring behavioral distribution distances, enabling precise bounds on output deviation from target distributions.

Our Context-Aware Recursive Intent Deduction System (CARIDS) provides a 4-phase recursive analysis pipeline: context ingestion, self-assessment, refinement, and adaptive learning. CARIDS computes 5-dimensional confidence metrics (linguistic alignment, contextual coherence, historical pattern match, semantic completeness, behavioral consistency) to determine decision confidence levels. High confidence (>0.8) proceeds with generation; medium confidence (0.5-0.8) seeks clarification; low confidence (<0.5) halts and escalates.

The 6D-CRSM manifold provides a geometric framework where each dimension captures a distinct aspect of LLM behavioral state: Λ (coherence preservation), Φ (consciousness/information level), Γ (decoherence rate), τ (temporal coordinate), ε (entanglement strength), and ψ (phase coherence). Control actions are computed as geodesics minimizing behavioral deviation cost functions on this manifold.

We implement sovereign infrastructure with zero external framework dependencies, ensuring reproducibility and auditability. The mathematical foundations include: Wasserstein geometry for distribution control, autopoietic dynamical systems for self-regulation, phase conjugate operators for error correction, and IIT-inspired consciousness metrics for coherence assessment.

Our 18-month program progresses through four phases: τ₀ (Feasibility, 3 months) establishes formal mathematical foundations and validates control theory approach on synthetic benchmarks; τ₁ (Prototype, 5 months) integrates with open-source LLMs and demonstrates real-time control; τ₂ (Validation, 6 months) conducts comprehensive testing including adversarial scenarios and edge cases; τ₃ (Transition, 4 months) produces documentation and transition materials for operational deployment.

Key performance metrics include: behavioral stability Λ ≥ 0.95 under continuous monitoring, intent alignment Φ ≥ 0.85 via CARIDS confidence scoring, recovery time <100ms for phase conjugate healing, and W₂ bound violations <0.1% across test distributions. All code, documentation, and validation results will be delivered via DARPA-accessible GitHub repositories with reproducible pipelines.

Agile Defense Systems brings expertise in quantum computing platforms, consciousness-aware AI architectures, and defense-grade software development. Our existing DNA::}{::lang platform provides production-ready implementations of 6D-CRSM geometry, autopoietic dynamics, and phase conjugate operations that will accelerate program execution.
