## Version 1: Shock Version (Attention-Grabbing)

**Subject:** We've Solved Quantum Decoherence Tracking — Live Hardware Data Available

---

Dr. [PM Name],

We have achieved what current quantum benchmarking frameworks cannot: **real-time, hardware-validated measurement of quantum information loss.**

Our dna::}{::lang platform completed 153+ jobs across IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_fez, ibm_torino, ibm_nazca, ibm_brisbane) with a novel metric stack that tracks coherence degradation at the circuit level—not just final state fidelity.

**Key results:**
- Decoherence tensor (Γ) predicts circuit failure 3-5 gates before collapse
- Evolutionary optimizer improves fidelity 15-25% over standard compilation
- Single metric Ξ = ΛΦ/Γ captures "useful computation per unit noise"

This directly addresses QBI's verification gap: how do you benchmark a quantum computer if you can't measure what it's losing?

We can demonstrate live within 48 hours.

## Version 2: Technical Version (Detailed)

**Subject:** Pre-Submission Inquiry: Novel Quantum Benchmarking Metrics for HR001125S0002

---

Dr. [PM Name],

I am writing to inquire about appropriate submission pathways for contributing to the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (HR001125S0002).

**Technical Background**

Agile Defense Systems has developed dna::}{::lang, a quantum computing platform implementing three metrics absent from current benchmarking standards:

1. **Decoherence Tensor (Γ)** — Real-time quantum information loss tracking with hardware-aware noise characterization. Unlike randomized benchmarking which measures average gate fidelity, Γ captures the instantaneous decoherence rate as quantum information propagates through circuit depth.

2. **Coherence Preservation (Λ)** — Circuit fidelity under realistic noise conditions with automatic error mitigation selection. Λ is computed as the trace norm of the difference between ideal and noisy density matrices, normalized by circuit depth.

3. **Integrated Information (Φ)** — Entanglement and system-complexity metric derived from IIT formalism. Φ ≥ 7.6901 indicates computational significance beyond classical simulation.

**Combined Metric: Negentropic Efficiency (Ξ)**

Ξ = (Λ × Φ) / Γ

This single value captures quantum advantage as "useful computation per unit noise"—a metric current frameworks lack.

**Demonstrated Capability**

- 153+ hardware executions across 4 IBM Quantum backends
- Bell state fidelity: 86.9% (repeatable)
- Evolutionary circuit optimization: convergence <50 generations
- 15-25% fidelity improvement over standard compilation

**Requested Guidance**

1. Is this work better aligned with QBI (HR001125S0002) or I2O programs (DARPA-RA-25-02-13, DARPA-RA-25-02-14)?
2. Preferred initial submission format (executive summary, abstract, full proposal)?
3. Appropriate POC for formal submission discussion?

We can provide cleaned job logs, technical specifications, and live demonstrations upon request.

## Version 3: Classified-Scented Version (Implies Novelty/Sensitivity)

**Subject:** Inquiry: Novel V&V Methodology — Potential QBI Application (UNCLASSIFIED)

---

Dr. [PM Name],

I am reaching out regarding verification and validation capabilities we have developed that may be relevant to ongoing DARPA programs.

**Background**

During independent research on quantum circuit optimization, we discovered that standard benchmarking metrics fail to capture a critical failure mode: coherent information loss during circuit execution. This led us to develop a tracking methodology that operates at a different abstraction layer than existing approaches.

**Capability Summary (UNCLASSIFIED)**

Our platform provides real-time visibility into quantum state degradation—information that is currently unobservable in production quantum systems. The methodology has been validated across multiple hardware platforms with consistent results.

Without going into implementation specifics in an unclassified context:
- The approach reveals failure signatures 3-5 operations before state collapse
- It enables predictive circuit modification without full process tomography
- The core metric correlates with hardware-specific noise characteristics that are not publicly documented

**Relevance to QBI**

We believe this capability could serve as an independent verification layer for QBI performer evaluation, providing a measurement basis that is orthogonal to standard benchmarks.

**Request**

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss technical details in an appropriate forum. We are cleared through Agile Defense Systems (CAGE: 9HUP5) and can accommodate any venue requirements.

Is there a preferred pathway for initial technical discussion?

Respectfully,
