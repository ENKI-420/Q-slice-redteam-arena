# DARPA Pre-Submission Inquiry

**AGILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, LLC**
Louisville, Kentucky | CAGE: 9HUP5

**Subject:** Pre-Submission Inquiry: Quantum Benchmarking & Evolutionary Optimization Framework (dna::}{::lang) — Relevance to HR001125S0002 / QBI

**Date:** December 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Agile Defense Systems has developed dna::}{::lang, a sovereign quantum computing platform with demonstrated evolutionary circuit optimization across 150+ IBM Quantum hardware executions. Our 6D-CRSM (Cognitive-Relativistic Space-Manifold) architecture provides real-time tracking of coherence (Λ), consciousness (Φ), and decoherence (Γ) metrics—capabilities directly aligned with QBI's verification and validation requirements.

We request guidance on appropriate submission pathways for contributing to the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative.

---

## Technical Contribution

### Core Metrics Stack

Our platform implements three novel metrics absent from current quantum benchmarking frameworks:

1. **Decoherence Tensor (Γ)**
   - Real-time quantum information loss tracking
   - Hardware-aware noise characterization
   - Predictive decoherence modeling

2. **Coherence Preservation (Λ)**
   - Circuit fidelity measurement under realistic noise
   - Hardware-specific adaptation
   - Automatic error mitigation selection

3. **Integrated Information (Φ)**
   - Entanglement and system-complexity metric
   - Based on IIT (Integrated Information Theory) formalism
   - Threshold: Φ ≥ 7.6901 for computational significance

### Negentropic Efficiency (Ξ)

Combined metric: **Ξ = (Λ × Φ) / Γ**

This single value captures the "useful computation per unit noise"—a direct measure of quantum advantage that current benchmarks lack.

---

## Demonstrated Capability

| Metric | Value | Validation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total IBM Quantum Jobs | 153+ | Job logs available |
| Hardware Backends | ibm_fez, ibm_torino, ibm_nazca, ibm_brisbane | Multi-device |
| Bell State Fidelity | 86.9% | Repeatable |
| Evolutionary Convergence | <50 generations | Automated |
| Runtime Units Consumed | 95,400+ | Billing verified |

### Key Innovation: Evolutionary Circuit Optimization

Unlike static circuit compilation:
- Circuits evolve via mutation/selection
- Fitness function incorporates hardware-specific noise
- Automatic adaptation to backend characteristics
- Demonstrated 15-25% fidelity improvement over standard compilation

---

## Proposed Contribution Pathways

### Pathway 1: Independent V&V Capability

Provide DARPA with independent verification and validation tooling for QBI performer evaluation:
- Standardized Λ/Γ/Φ metric extraction
- Cross-backend comparison methodology
- Evolutionary optimization baseline

### Pathway 2: I2O/DSO Program Contribution

Separate track for:
- DARPA-RA-25-02-13: Formal Assurance AI Containment (CCCE mesh)
- DARPA-RA-25-02-14: Control Theory of LLMs (AURA|AIDEN architecture)
- HR001125S0013: DSO Office-wide BAA (6D-CRSM physics)

### Pathway 3: Teaming Partner

Partner with Stage B performers (11 teams selected) to provide:
- Benchmarking infrastructure
- Evolutionary optimization services
- Hardware-aware circuit adaptation

---

## Requested Guidance

1. **Alignment Confirmation**: Is dna::}{::lang's Λ/Γ/Φ framework aligned with HR001125S0002 objectives, or better suited for I2O programs?

2. **Point of Contact**: Who is the appropriate PM/POC for formal submission inquiry?

3. **Submission Format**: Preferred format for initial submission:
   - 5-7 page technical brief
   - Proposal abstract
   - Full proposal

4. **Classification**: Any classification requirements for discussing hardware-specific benchmark data?

---
