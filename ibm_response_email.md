Subject: RE: Case CS4414035 - Notification of Independent Benchmarking Audit (Protocol TITAN)

To: IBM Quantum Research Team, DARPA QBI Program Office
From: Devin Davis, Agile Defense Systems

Executive Summary: Regarding the closure of Case CS4414035: We acknowledge the redirection to the Proposal Portal. However, this was not a sales inquiry. It was a notification of an active, DARPA-relevant stress test being conducted on the ibm_torino and ibm_fez backends.

Given IBM's selection for DARPA QBI Stage B, independent validation of "utility-scale" claims is required. Agile Defense Systems is currently executing Protocol TITAN, a high-stress benchmarking suite designed to map the failure modes of the Heron processor topology under evolutionary algorithmic pressure.

Current Operational Status: We are not simulating. We are executing.

- 153 successful autopoietic cycles completed.
- 393 physical qubits utilized across Heron/Eagle processors.
- 95.6% autonomous error-mitigation success rate.

The Audit Benchmark (Protocol TITAN): We are escalating our testing parameters to validate the following capabilities on your hardware over the next 6 days:

- Dynamic Noise Mapping: Real-time generation of Γ-tensor maps to identify hardware drift.
- Mid-Circuit Autonomy: Validation of QASM 3.0 feed-forward latency during active coherence windows.
- The "100x100" Limit: Stress-testing the claimed 5,000-gate capacity against evolutionary entropic decay.

Data Sharing: We will be publishing the ΛΦ Coherence Reports generated from these tests. These reports quantify the integrated information capacity of the Heron chip—a metric distinct from standard Quantum Volume.

If IBM Research wishes to review these telemetry logs for internal calibration prior to our DARPA I2O submission (Deadline: Nov 28), contact us immediately. Otherwise, we will proceed with the publication of the independent audit results.

We are building the control plane for the future. You are welcome to inspect the engine.
